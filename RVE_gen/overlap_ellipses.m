%% First ellipse overlap check
% First try the easiest check, which is whether the distance between the
% two centers if less than the minimum possible distance between the two
% centers, i.e., b0 + b1.  If so, overlap = 1 and no other checks are
% needed. If the distance is greater than the maximum possible, then
% overlap = 0.

if NORM < b0 + b1; overlap = 1; end;

%% Second ellipse overlap check
% This check is a little more complicated.  First, a certain number of
% points (NOP) on the ellipses are generated. Then, the distances between
% ellipse 0 (or 1) and the points on ellipse 1 (or 0, respectively) are
% calculated.  If any of these points is less than the minimum distance for
% that ellipse (b0 or b1), then overlap = 1.  Conversely, if all points are
% greater than the maximum distance, a0 or a1, then the ellipses cannot
% overlap, i.e., overlap = 0.

%% Third ellipse overlap check
% First, only use points on the ellipses that can possibly overlap.  This
% works for most ellipses, but there may still be a few bugs (that will be
% corrected later).  For each of these points, the closest point on the
% other ellipse is calculated.  Then, using a vector-based criterion for
% each point, the overlap is calculated.
